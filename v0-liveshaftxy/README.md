# V0 Live Shaft XY Joint

Live shaft XY joint for the V0.2 with some "stealth-ification"

The custom pulley is available from filastruder [here](https://www.filastruder.com/products/gates-2gt-pulley-custom-no-grub-set-screw?_pos=1&_sid=243b784b2&_ss=r&variant=41243545174087)

This *should* get rid of the 2mm ripple you see in your prints at higher belt tensions
